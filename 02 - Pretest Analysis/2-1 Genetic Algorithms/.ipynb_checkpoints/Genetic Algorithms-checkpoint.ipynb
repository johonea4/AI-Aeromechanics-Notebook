    "Originally termed Machine Evolution, Genetic Algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection (evolution). In genetic algorithms, successor states are generated by combining 2 parent states. This is analogous to Natural Selection by means of sexual reproduction  in nature. Here, as in nature, random mutations occur in the offspring. For each generation set, the best mate, reproduce, and create a new generation."

Some mutations will not matter too much, and others will be a drastic change that will either be discarded because it can't survive under the given conditions, or it will change the direction of the population where the mutation will propogate through the population in successive generations.\n",
