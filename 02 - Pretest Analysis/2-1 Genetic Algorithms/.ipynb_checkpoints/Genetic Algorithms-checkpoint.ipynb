    "Originally termed Machine Evolution, Genetic Algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection (evolution). In genetic algorithms, successor states are generated by combining 2 parent states. This is analogous to Natural Selection by means of sexual reproduction  in nature. Here, as in nature, random mutations occur in the offspring. For each generation set, the best mate, reproduce, and create a new generation."

Some mutations will not matter too much, and others will be a drastic change that will either be discarded because it can't survive under the given conditions, or it will change the direction of the population where the mutation will propogate through the population in successive generations.\n",

    "In Aeromechanical testing, the first step is to find where to place the sensors. We do this by utilizing finite element models, where the complex model is broken up into smaller primitive types and the stress/strain of these elemnts are more easily computed. The streeses and strains for a given element are defined at the element's nodes. For simplicity, this example will only deal with placement at a given node, off-node mappings will not be performed.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$NumSensors * \\log_{2} (NumNodes) = NumBits$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, the genetic string will contain information for the node the sensor is mapped. Setting these values will also populate a data set. The data set will be generated by randomly selecting a node for each mode set, assigning the node a value of 1.0 representing 100% ratio to max and then all other nodes surrounding it will taper to 0. For example: Given a 5 node setting, node 3 is randomly selected. Node 3 ratio will be 1.0. Therefore, Node 2 = 0.5, Node 1 = 0.0, Node 4 = 0.5, Node 5 = 0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting the model settings, you will need to set the settings for the genetic algorithm. This will consist of the same information as the previous example, but will add an objective. The objective function is set to the minimum amplitude ratio for the design to detect for all modes. For example, if 2 modes are set, one sensor, and an objective of 0.3 the mapped sensor's strain must ratio to the max strain of each mode >= 0.3."

    "In this lesson we have gone over the genetic algorithm. We have discussed what the algorithm is and how it works. We have also gone over detailed examples of implementation. The first example sought to create a solution for the NQueens puzzle. We saw how the algorithm worked, saw the example implementation, and observed its performance. Finally, we looked at an example as it relates to the field of aeromechanical testing. This example sought to find a solution where the specified number of sensors were able to cover one or more dynamic mode shapes with a set minimum objective ratio. The genetic algorithm is a great tool and works well for state spaced models. Please review the sample code, try to improve it, and play with the available dials for tuning the algorithm."
