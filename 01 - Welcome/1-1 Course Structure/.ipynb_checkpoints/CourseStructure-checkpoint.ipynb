    "The current section, the Introductory section, is meant to introduce you to the course, its structure, and to the concept of AI. Following this piece of section 1, you will learn exactly what AI is and ramifications of its use. The Pre-Test Analysis section will cover analysis using finite elemnt models to determine sensor location for a test. This section will provide a breif overview of the finite elemnt method and why it is used. Finally, the Data Analysis section will look at the testing and post-test phases. It will discuss methods in applying AI to signal analysis for use in feature detection and navigating through the noise. Each lesson will provide an introduction to the subject, a detailed description of the algorithm and what it is doing, a visual example, a detailed example as it relates to aeromechanical testing, and additional resources for furhter reading."

A lot in the area of Computer Science is discovered through doing. The assignments will range based on the topic. Some of the assignments will be programming assignments in python where you will need to complete the implementation of some shell code. Other assignments will simply be readings or a research task. The exact assignment structure and type will be at the instructor's descretion. Each self assignment will be accompanied with a estimated time to complete the task for your information of expected difficulty. Each assignment is assigned at the beginning of the week for the current lesson, and will usually be due at midnight at the start of the subsequent week."
