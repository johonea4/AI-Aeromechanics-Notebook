    "Welcome to the course on AI in Aeromechanics. This course will be covering different AI techniques that can be applied to standard aeromechanical testing. This course will cover content in both the pre-test and post-test sides of analysis. The pre-test portion will focus on utilizing the finite element method and using AI to determine sensor placement and count. The post-test side will focus on using AI techniques to detect patterns visible in the signal. The main goals of this course are as follows:\n",
    ">  \n",
    "1. De-Mystify the concept of AI\n",
    "2. Induce confidence in using AI in aeromechanical testing\n",
    "3. Provide a deep understanding of different AI techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "It is intended for the presented AI methods be implemented by the engineers taking this course. This will inevitably result in lower costs for testing, lower quantity of needed analysts, and reduce the time to part certification. If the industry begins to deploy AI agents, the agents will be able to learn more, become more accurate, and overall do more. As the agents improve and their abilities broaden, the difficulty imposed by analysis will inevitably decrease."
