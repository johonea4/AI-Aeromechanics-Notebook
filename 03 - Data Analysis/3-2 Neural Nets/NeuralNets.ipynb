    "Artificial Neural Networks are inspired by the hypothesis that mental activity consists primarily of electromechanical activity in networks of brain cells called neurons. These neurons perform a simple function based on its inputs, and output signals if certain conditions are met. ANN's are an artificial intelligence technique used for visual processing, pattern recognition, and several other tasks. ANN's also have the ability to learn through given examples without any prior knowledge.\n",

They gained a lot of popularity in the early research of AI in the 1980's, and eventually faded due to complexity and lack of computational power for large net systems. However, they have lately started to be re-evaluated and implemented since systems today are much more powerful, and they are being used heavily in some speech recognition systems and visual processors."
