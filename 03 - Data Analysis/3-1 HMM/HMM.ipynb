    "We view the world as a series of frames or snapshots in time, each of which contains a set of random variables where some are observable, and some are not. Hidden Markov Models or HMM's, are a machine learning technique used to make sense of sequences in time. HMM's have recently come to dominate the field of speech recognition. These models are good at taking frames that make up an input signal and feedback a result based on that model. HMM's are based on a rigourous set of mathematical theory which allowed speech researchers to build onto previous mathematical results developed in other fields. HMM's must be trained for a particular end result. In speech recognition, this could be a word or  series of words. In HMMS' these models are able to distinguish a signal with noise present, or different magnitudes, or even durations of states. This is the power available in HMM's.\n",
